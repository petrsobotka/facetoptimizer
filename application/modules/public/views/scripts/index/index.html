<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		
<div id="content">
	<p>FacetOptimizer is an Open Source project whose main goal is to provide a software tool for Faceted Navigation analysis and optimization.</p>
	
	<p>If your website incorporates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_classification">Faceted Classification</a>, doesn't matter whether it is an e-shop or non-profit catalogue, this tool can give you new insight into 
	the way visitors behave on your site and interact with facets.</p>  
	
	<p>The tool is built on top of <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> and <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine 2</a>. 
	It provides a RESTful API for easy integration with client applications. </p>
	
	<p>Source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/petrsobotka/facetoptimizer">GitHub</a> repository.</p>
	
	<p>The application can be used as hosted service or using custom installation.</p>
